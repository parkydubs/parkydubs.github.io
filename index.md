# Hello, I'm Parker!

I am a [Boston College][bc] student studying Computer Science with minors in Accounting for Finance and Consulting, and Music. In my free time, you can find me swimming (barely staying afloat), honing my skills with my violin, and cheffing-up delicious home-cooked meals in the kitchen!
